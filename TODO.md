# Plans for this plugin

## Fishing system

~~Fishing will work like in vanilla.~~  
~~Player gets a special tagged fishing rod when entering the fishing area.~~

Fishing rod will be upgradable later. Support for skins is planned.

There will be an advanced command system (WIP).  
There will be beautiful messages when failing to catch a fish etc.

## Area system

~~Areas are regions which automatically swap inventory upon entering.~~

~~Areas will use adapters to support multiple region plugins and to work
standalone with a builtin one.~~

Planned adapters:

- ~~Builtin (square regions only)~~
- ~~WorldGuard (advanced permissions and shapes)~~

## Reward system

Plugin will have different kinds of awards, including:

- ~~Builtin points~~
- ~~Vault (Economy)~~
- ~~Commands~~
- ~~Messages~~
- ~~Action Bar~~
- ~~Title~~
- ~~Container~~
- ~~Items (for later)~~

Physical rewards (items) are stashed and given upon leaving the area.
Might create a stash plugin and use it as a hook.

## Point system

~~Points can be fully disabled and configured, they come with out-of-the-box
PlaceholderAPI support and will support exchanging for other good in future (as
alternative currency with exclusive items).~~

Planned placeholders:

- ~~%fishybusiness_points% - Returns the amount of points player has~~
- ~~%fishybusiness_top_points% - Returns top 10 points~~
- ~~%fishybusiness_top_points_<place> - Returns name and points of certain to
  place~~
