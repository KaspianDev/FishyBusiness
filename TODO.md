# Plans for this plugin

## Fishing system

Fishing will work like in vanilla.  
Player gets a special tagged fishing rod when entering the fishing area.

## Area system

Areas are regions which automatically swap inventory upon entering.

Areas will use adapters to support multiple region plugins and to work
standalone with a builtin one.

Planned adapters:

- Builtin (square regions only)
- WorldGuard (advanced permissions and shapes)

## Reward system

Plugin will have different kinds of awards, including:

- Builtin points
- Vault (Economy)
- Commands
- Items (for later)

Physical rewards (items) are stashed and given upon leaving the area.

## Point system

Points can be fully disabled and configured, they come with out-of-the-box
PlaceholderAPI support and will support exchanging for other good in future (as
alternative currency with exclusive items).
